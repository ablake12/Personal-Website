                <p class="indent">My name is Alanza Blake, a Software Engineer and a 2022 Magna Cum Laude Spelman College graduate from Maplewood, New Jersey. I first became interested in Computer Science when I did the Girls Who Code summer immersion program in 2016, where I got a chance to create projects using python and html programming languages. I also got the opportunity to visit successful technology companies and institutions such as Audible and the New York Fashion Institute of Technology, during my time at the program. However, one thing that bothered me was the lack of women and people of color in the technology industry. From then on, I’ve been dedicated to changing this stigma and breaking that barrier as a woman of color myself. Since Girls Who Code, I remained active in the organization as Vice President of the Girls Who Code Spelman College loop. This student organization allowed me to hold office hours for underclassmen students and host a successful collaborative event with Citi that exposed the students to the opportunities at the company. In addition to this, I was able to exercise another passion: serving my community by assuming the role of Treasurer for Event Envoys, a student organization that specializes in educating students about the hospitality industry and management principles. Finally, I had the privilege of serving as an upperclassman mentor in Spelman Protégé, an organization committed to offering freshman students professional guidance and opportunities. My involvement during my undergraduate career has further fueled my lifelong passion for service and I get to continue that service as a new member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated. Through these experiences, I have developed skills such as leadership, management, communication, adaptability, a technical skillset, and problem-solving.</p>

    <p class="indent">I started my professional career in Summer 2020 when I interned at Optum as a research fellow for the Optum Startup Studio, the company’s startup accelerator. I collaborated on a team of 5 to evaluate and recommend innovative healthcare startups to senior leadership. Following this experience, I returned in Summer 2021 for a software engineering internship, where I worked with a team to create a full-stack software application that would allow clinicians to leverage Artificial Intelligence as a colleague. I collaborated with my team to develop a Python module that provides clinicians with AI information. Additionally, I designed and implemented a React.js user interface to display this information and have the clinician complete an interactive calibration process. I thoroughly enjoyed both my internships at Optum, leading me to join full-time upon graduating with my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science in May 2022. I spent my first year in the company in a rotational program where I got to experience various areas of technology, including software engineering, data visualization, and product management. Presently, I hold the position of Associate Software Engineer at Optum, where I specialize in Python coding for multiple file generation processes within the Community and State organization.</p>
    <p class="indent">Lastly, during my free time, I enjoy community service, baking, exercising, spending time with family and friends, and traveling. These hobbies not only bring me joy and fulfillment but also complement my professional interests and goals. I'm excited to continue pursuing these activities and I'm particularly looking forward to embarking on a trip to Europe this Summer to further enrich my experiences!</p>
